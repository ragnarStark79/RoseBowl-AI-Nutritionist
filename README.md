## üìä Data Flow Overview

1.  **User Interaction:** Users interact with the Flutter UI via text input or voice commands (STT).
2.  **AI Chat Processing:** Text/Voice input intended for the chatbot is sent to the **Gemini AI** backend. Gemini processes the query and returns a relevant, conversational response.
3.  **Meal Plan Request:** User preferences (diet type, calories, etc.) are sent to the **Spoonacular API** to request meal plan data or specific recipes.
4.  **Data Display:** The app receives responses from Gemini AI and Spoonacular API, formats the data, and displays it to the user (text, meal cards, etc.). TTS can be used to read out information.
5.  **Local Storage:** User settings, preferences, and explicitly saved recipes/plans are stored locally using **SharedPreferences** for persistence across app sessions.

*(Optional: Consider creating visual diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid syntax if GitHub renders it, or linking image files) for a more detailed representation if needed)*
